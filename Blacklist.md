# Blacklisted software
This software is not safe for use, often will comproise your privacy or put your systems security at risk.

## Desktop
 * Windows 10 - Phones home and collects Telemetry data
 * AVG - Will sell your data to 3rd parties, Their browser plugin has several vulneribilities
 * Antivius in general - generally poorly made today, Norton AV has had numerous bugs in their scanners (by no means an issue limited to them).
 * IE/Edge - im lumping them together notoriously insecure not to mention they invent their own standards that mess with the web.
 * truecrypt - author stopped developing left cryptic hints of major issues ... use veracrypt its a fork undergoing 3rd party security audits

## Android
 * ES File Explorer - once a great software, its bloated ad filled and i suspect some tests will say calling home too.
